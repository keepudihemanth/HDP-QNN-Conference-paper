# Existing Work

Several machine learning models have been applied to
heart disease prediction. Logistic Regression achieved an
accuracy of around 81% [14], while Decision Trees performed
slightly lower at 79% [15]. Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs)
demonstrated improved performance with accuracies near
83% [13]. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) combined with
ANN reached comparable results [12]. However, these models
either lacked robustness to nonlinear feature interactions or re-
quired heavy preprocessing. The proposed QNN-based hybrid
model differs by incorporating a variational quantum circuit
layer, enabling enhanced representation of feature correlations.
Our results show that QNN achieved an accuracy of 82.88%
and F1-score of 0.848, outperforming some classical baselines
while offering quantum-enhanced generalization.
